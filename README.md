# 3d-rbc
Solves the non-dimensional fluid equations for rotating convection under the Boussinesq approximation. Non-dimensionalised using the viscous diffusion time 
and solved using the Dedalus framework. 

Running the job.sh submits a new run.

Running the run-analysis.sh analyses the run and outputs key features of the flow and graphs.

The snapshot and analysis directories have to be merged before analysis.
